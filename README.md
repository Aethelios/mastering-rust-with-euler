Rust solutions to Project Euler programming problems

This repository contains my solutions to Project Euler problems implemented in Rust.

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. The motivation is to take on these problems and translate them into optimized, efficient code using the power of Rust.
also, I'm trying to learn rust :sweat_smile:

## Repository Contents

The repository is structured as follows:

- Within the "bin" folder is Rust files named `p001.rs`, `p002.rs`, etc. containing the code to solve that problem. 
- Solutions aim to be efficient and leverage Rust's performance advantages where possible.
- Unit tests may be included for verification in some solutions.

## Contributing 

Contributions are very welcome! Before submitting a pull request:

- Ensure your solution passes all test cases for the Euler problem.
- Avoid brute force solutions and aim for computational efficiency.   
- Make sure code is neatly formatted, documented, and follows Rust style guidelines.

## Getting Started

To use this repository:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Aethelios/mastering-rust-with-euler.git`
2. Install Rust if needed (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)  
3. Run solutions using `cargo run --bin p001` (replace with problem number)

Let me know if you need any help getting started!
